**p8**

The project plan to construct a simple virtural computer:
- `p8/vm` a vm interpreter for a simple RISC machine
- `p8/asm` assembler and deassembler
- `p8/ssa` a ssa-like IR interpreter
- `p8/ssac` a compiler back-end that compiles IR to asm
- `p8/gc` a compiler for a simple high-level programming language, G language
  to IR
- `p8/ui` a web-based user interface for the machine
- `p8/sys` a toy os written in G
- `p8/cc` a full-fledged C compiler
- `p8/goc` a full-fledged Go language compiler
- and more

This project just sounds crazy... so please don't expect me to finish it...
