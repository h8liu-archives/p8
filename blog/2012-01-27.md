** Lonely Project **

This is more like a lonely and useless project. It aims to build a virtual
machine that no one would probably use in the end.

The virtual machine would work in the browser. So the main code would be
javascript.

I think I plan to build it mostly all from scratch.

Why from scratch? First, I don't really have any pressure on the construction
speed, it's not a time driven project. If it takes too long time to build, it
won't hurt. Second, I would like to have the confident at the end of project,
or at any time of building this thing, to say that, I understand how each piece
works. If I just port some modern tools in, I won't be able to say that.

Javascript will be used for building the simple bootstrap tools, the virtual
machine engine and the simple user interface. The plan is after the virtual
machine is stable, I would be mainly working inside a VM for developing, using
tools that I built by my own.

I would probably need to re-learn and re-think a lot of stuff, like parsing,
compiling, language design, interface design, operating system design, and so
on.

** History **

I have written a simple VM in golang before this. However, the go version is
more like just prototyping the idea. Once I move to javascript, I changed
the RISC to a 32bit integer one, because javascript natively only supports 32bit
well. And since the final goal is to write the VM in javascript so that it could
be accessed by anyone easily, there is no point to write the VM in golang here.

Coffeescript makes javascript much easy to use, but I still love golang. The hope
is that after the virtual environment is built up, I can start design my own 
golang-like language in the virtual environment and play with that.

** Bootstrap **

To bootstrap the development, I need to first build some tools for testing the
virtual machine.
