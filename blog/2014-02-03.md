**Compiler**

Since I really hate writing javascript, I plan to write a go compiler, that
compiles to my simple instruction set first. Since I am going to write this
compiler anyway.

It seems that designing a programming langauge and writing a compiler could be
really hard. So let's stick on our first goal which is only an assembly
language, a simple message passing microkernel virtual machine architecture,
an simple function line based assembler and something simple like that.

And since I hate javascript and coffeescript for prototyping (because they are
hard to debug), I will implement the first prototype of the virtual machine in 
golang rather than in javascript. It will have a terminal though (in fact two
terminals, one is just for debugging), to interact with the backend, via
websocket (possibly)

Good. Now we can write the arch in golang first.

Once it is working and relatively stable, we will consider hand translate it
into coffeescript, which will then make the virtual machine, the assembler,
the deassembler, the debugger, the terminal framebuffer handler and so on,
all running inside the browswer.

We will then run a tictactoe program with two AI's as an working example.

Afterwards, we will start our long journey on designing our own language and
writing our own compiler.
